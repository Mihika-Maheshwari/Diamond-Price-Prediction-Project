# Diamond Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat weight, cut, clarity, color, and depth. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a diamond given its characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8/data?select=train.csv). It contains information about various diamonds, including their attributes and corresponding prices. The dataset is provided in csv format and can be found in the `data` directory. 


## Results

The results of the diamond price prediction are evaluated based on various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model and how well it predicts diamond prices.
